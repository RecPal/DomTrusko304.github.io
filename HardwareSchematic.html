                Due to the requirements of the project, two power systems are required. One power system is for the
                ESP32, while the 5v system is used to drive the pulse pins on the stepper motor driver. After my team
                swap I repurposed this system
                to operate as a 5v software SPI driver for an external display. This did not require any hardware
                modifications to function.

            <p class="content-text">
                My board needs to interface with a 24v stepper motor, driven by an external driver. This driver requires
                a 5v magnitude for the pulse, which cannot be provided by the 3.3v microcontroller. My solution is
                to use MOSFETs with a trigger at 0.7v to activate the 5v pulse, which in turn drives the motor driver.
                The original project design involved driving a stepper motor using these GPIO pins, but after being
                moved to the new team my subsystem was repurposed to utilize
                software-based SPI. This adaptation did not hinder the functionality of this subsystem, and was still
                driven using the same hardware. While this was almost certainly
                not necessary given the new requirements, the board was already manufactured and making modifications
                would not have provided any improved functionality given the time
                constraints.

                The bill of materials includes all components across all documents, including their quantity, model
                number, and manufacturer. These will be updated as final part decisions are made. For some components,
                such as resistors,
                they will be bulk-ordered to minimize the friction of ordering individual units. We will keep them at
                the same size to ensure easy integration with whatever our final decision is.

                To ensure sufficient power flow from the supply to adequately power all required hardware, I have
                generated this power budget showing the allocation required
                to drive all necessary hardware. The screen has rather minor power draw, but to provide ample safety margin I elected to maintain the 
                750mA fuse, so while the power is overspecced for the setup, it is a completely valid option for this setup.

                I have elected to only show components that actually have a notable power draw to minimize the work
                required to streamline the document, especially given the quantity of individual components.
