            <p> While it doesn't show on the board, once mounted within the housing it is exceptionally sturdy. Given
                its Potential
                presence within an interactive museum exhibit, this makes sense. Nobody wants their exhibit to break.
                This could be improved
                further by improving the screen communication speed to display full-color images as well as replacing
                the dupont pins with a locking solution,
                such as a MOLEX header with a binding clip. </p>

        <div class="content-text">
            <p> This design was made without input from my team, as I joined the team at the very end. Much of the functionality of the board was removed
                to minimize system complexity for rapid integration. This board could be shrunk, likely to a size smaller than the screen it supports, by removing the support hardware
            for the secondary voltage regulator, MOSFETS, and screw-terminals in favor of meeting the requirements more stringently. </p>

        <h1 class="content-header">Potential Improvements</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
            <p> Given another try, much would be improved. Most of the failures of this design stem from it being
                designed for an
                entirely different functionality, but being adapted to work as an HMI system. Doing so required
                repurposing GPIO and extremely
                low-speed SPI communication pins. While this works, it means the full-color functionality of the screen
                had to be removed in favor
                of using a color-inversion system with colored film to allow the screen refresh-rate to keep up with the
                sensor input. Here is a list of potential improvements we brainstormed during our post-mortem meeting.</p>

                    <li>
                        Change GPIO pins to hardware SPI pins to speed up serial communication with screen.

                    <li>
                        Remove support hardware for 5v stepper login to minimize board size.

                        Integrate the shared unregulated power to a daisy-chain pin for ease of use.

                    <li>
                        Relocate the ESP to the edge for ease of removal, and to minimize WIFI interference.

                If we find time we might put in the extra 5% to make this project even cooler, but we have big plans for summer
                projects that should keep us busy. I learned a lot designing this board, particularly regarding USB interfacing,
                and it has definitely improved my design skills. I am one board design away from perfection, but I can save that 
                for capstone.

                Due to the requirements of the project, two power systems are required. One power system is for the
                ESP32, while the 5v system is used to drive the pulse pins on the stepper motor driver. After my team
                swap I repurposed this system
                to operate as a 5v software SPI driver for an external display. This did not require any hardware
                modifications to function.

                My board needs to interface with an SPI display. This display can be run at either 3.3v or 5v.
                Originally, we had it running on 5v using this MOSFET bus. Following a component failure in the 5v
                regulator, I elected to bypass the 5v regulator and wire the 3.3v signal directly into the SPI chip.
                Most of this page is irrelevant, as it worked in the final design,
                but I decided to keep it here just in case, as it is present on the PCB.

                To ensure sufficient power flow from the supply to adequately power all required hardware, I have
                generated this power budget showing the allocation required
                to drive all necessary hardware. The screen has rather minor power draw, but to provide ample safety
                margin I elected to maintain the
                750mA fuse, so while the power is overspecced for the setup, it is a completely valid option for this
                setup.

            <p class="content-text">
                I have elected to only show components that actually have a notable power draw to minimize the work
                required to streamline the document, especially given the quantity of individual components.

                The output of my voltage regulator is 500mA at 3.3v. Which means that it is capable of powering all
                hardware during peak output

                <h1> Estimating Power Needs </h1>
                Thankfully, I overspecced my voltage regulator. This means that integrating the new screen, which had a higher power-draw than the original system requirements,
                did not overstrain the system. During the design phase I had originally used a 500mA fuse, but elected to replace it with a 750mA fuse. This saved my system, and
                exemplified why you include safety margins in designs.
